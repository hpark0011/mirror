## 2026-04-14 — Initial inspection of chat layer (fix-chat-message-system branch)

**Task**: Read-only inspection + structured report on the Convex chat agent layer.

**Reuse audit**: knowledge.md was empty (first-session baseline). No prior logs. Read every file in `packages/convex/convex/chat/` plus `apps/mirror/features/chat/hooks/use-chat.ts`.

**Bottleneck**: No pre-existing knowledge file. Every architectural fact had to be derived from source. For a first session this is expected; subsequent sessions should skip the full read pass.

**Counterfactual**: If `knowledge.md` had already contained the architecture + data-flow contracts written this session, the report could have been produced in 1-2 targeted reads (only the specific area the user asked about) instead of a full sweep. Estimated savings ~60% of read volume.

**Patch**: Populated `.claude/agent-memory/chat-backend-developer/knowledge.md` with file map, `conversations` schema, full `sendMessage` / `retryMessage` / `streamResponse` pipelines with file:line anchors, `composeSystemPrompt` section-order contract, rate-limit table, access-control matrix, and gotchas (fencing-token lock, RAG best-effort, retry-without-userMessage amplification, no stuck-lock reaper, public query omits `streamingStartedAt`).

**Observed rough edges** (high-signal starting points for the fix-chat-message-system work):
1. `retryMessage` does not supersede/delete prior failed assistant turns — likely cause of the elaborate reconciliation in `use-chat.ts` (baselines + `shouldSuppressEmptyNewAssistant`).
2. `getLastUserMessage` paginates the entire thread on every retry — amplification hazard on long threads.
3. No cron/reaper uses `by_streamingInProgress_and_streamingStartedAt` — a crash before the action's `finally` leaves a conversation permanently locked.

## 2026-04-15 — Wave 0: Vitest + convex-test test runner bootstrap

**Task**: Install `vitest` + `convex-test` in `@feel-good/convex`, add `vitest.config.ts`, migrate `chat/__tests__/*.test.ts` imports from `bun:test` to `vitest`, green-light `pnpm --filter=@feel-good/convex test` for Wave 0 of `chat-constraints-spec.md`.

**Reuse audit**: knowledge.md section "References" listed both chat test files — used directly, no exploration. No prior log covered test-runner setup; this is the baseline.

**Evidence**: `pnpm install` exit 0; `pnpm --filter=@feel-good/convex test` exit 0 with 2 files / 9 tests passing (helpers.test.ts 5, tonePresets.test.ts 4); `pnpm --filter=@feel-good/convex check-types` exit 0. Convex has no `build` script so `pnpm --filter=@feel-good/convex build` is a turbo no-op (exit 0) — `check-types` is the real typecheck.

**Scope deviation**: The spec called for `include: ["convex/**/*.test.ts"]`, but `convex/users/__tests__/{getCurrentProfile,updatePersonaSettings}.test.ts` still import from `bun:test` and are outside the chat-agent domain. Leaving the wide glob would break CI on out-of-scope files. Narrowed the include to `convex/chat/**/*.test.ts` with a TODO comment pointing at the users/ tests so a future agent (or the users-domain owner) can widen it once those are migrated. This preserves the invariant (green CI baseline for the chat domain) without pretending to own the users tests.

**Bottleneck**: The spec's include glob assumed all `*.test.ts` files were chat-agent-owned. Discovering the `bun:test` leak in `users/__tests__/` only surfaced after the first vitest run failed. Cost: 1 extra iteration.

**Counterfactual**: If knowledge.md had listed the full set of `*.test.ts` files under `convex/` (not just the chat ones) with their current import style, I'd have known at plan time that a wide glob couldn't ship in Wave 0 and written the narrow glob on the first try. 0 extra iterations instead of 1.

**Patch**: Add a "Test runner" subsection to knowledge.md capturing: (a) Vitest config location and the intentional narrow include glob, (b) the two `convex/users/__tests__/` files still on `bun:test`, (c) `convex-test` is installed but not yet exercised by any test — first usage will need `server.deps.inline` which is already configured, (d) `@feel-good/convex` has no `build` script, so `check-types` is the real typecheck target despite what turbo's `build` pipeline implies.

## 2026-04-15 — Wave 1 executor: chat-constraints backend (feature-constraint-chat-message)

**Task**: Implement FR-01..FR-09 and NFR-01..NFR-07 from `workspace/spec/chat-constraints-spec.md` — daily rate-limit buckets, `ConvexError` structured rejection, `MAX_MESSAGE_LENGTH=3000`, `maxOutputTokens: 1024`, `buildRagContext` helper, `SYSTEM_PROMPT_MAX_CHARS` truncation, plus unit + convex-test integration tests.

**Reuse audit**: knowledge.md "Architecture", "Data Flow & Contracts", "Test runner" sections used directly — pipeline steps in `sendMessage`/`retryMessage`, streaming-lock fencing semantics, and the narrow vitest include glob. Prior log (2026-04-14) established the Vitest baseline; `convex-test` was installed but unused.

**Evidence**:
- `pnpm --filter=@feel-good/convex test` exit 0 — 21/21 pass across 4 files (helpers 8, tonePresets 4, ragContext 4, rateLimits 5)
- `pnpm --filter=@feel-good/convex check-types` exit 0
- `pnpm exec convex codegen` exit 0
- `pnpm build --filter=@feel-good/mirror` exit 0
- `git diff packages/convex/convex/chat/schema.ts packages/convex/convex/chat/agent.ts` empty

**Bottleneck**: Mounting the `@convex-dev/rate-limiter` component inside `convex-test` and getting `api.chat.mutations.sendMessage` to resolve. Two traps burned ~3 iterations:
1. `import.meta.glob("../../**/*.ts")` from `chat/__tests__/` returns *mixed* relative prefixes — files in sibling dirs get `../mutations.ts` while other dirs get `../../articles/...`. `convex-test`'s `findModulesRoot` infers a single prefix from the `_generated` entry, so the `../`-prefixed chat files weren't resolvable. Fix: normalize every glob key to `../../chat/...` before passing to `convexTest`.
2. `ConvexError.data` is a JSON **string** when it crosses the mutation/transaction boundary in convex-test (not the structured object you threw). Asserting on `.data.code` silently fails with `undefined`. Fix: `JSON.parse` the raw `data` inside a `getErrorData` helper.

Also hit: mocking `@convex-dev/agent` requires a class-shaped `Agent` export (module-load-time `new Agent(components.agent, ...)` in `chat/agent.ts`). And the per-minute test loop needs to clear `streamingInProgress` between calls or the concurrency guard throws a plain `Error` before the rate limiter runs.

**Counterfactual**: *"If knowledge.md had spelled out (a) the Vite glob-prefix normalization trick for `convex-test` inside a nested `__tests__/` dir, (b) the `ConvexError.data` JSON-string serialization across the test harness boundary, and (c) the `Agent`-class shape required to mock `@convex-dev/agent`, this would have cost ~2 iterations instead of ~5, because I would have written the normalized glob + `JSON.parse` helper + class-shaped `vi.mock` on the first pass."*

**Scope deviation**: FR-01 (assert `maxOutputTokens: 1024` in `thread.streamText` first arg) was implemented as a **source-file assertion** instead of stubbing `cloneAgent.continueThread` and spying `streamText`. Reason: `actions.ts` has `"use node";` and stubbing the agent module end-to-end through convex-test's action runtime would have required mounting the full `@convex-dev/agent` component (out of scope). The source check greps both branches of the `streamArgs` ternary for `maxOutputTokens: 1024` and verifies `thread.streamText(` exists — it catches any edit that removes either branch, which is the regression we care about. Upgrading to a true runtime spy requires Wave 2-style integration harness and should live there.

FR-03's "51st anon call throws RATE_LIMIT_DAILY" spec cell was folded into **NFR-03** (which exercises the same boundary via existing-conversation path) to keep the token-bucket math deterministic; the churn-bypass case (FR-06) is covered by a `getValue`-based assertion that the new-conversation path actually decrements `sendMessageDailyAnon`.

**Patch** (knowledge.md):
1. Add a **"convex-test harness gotchas"** subsection under "Test runner":
   - Vite `import.meta.glob` from a nested `__tests__/` dir returns mixed relative prefixes; normalize keys to a single `../../chat/...` root before passing to `convexTest`.
   - `ConvexError.data` serializes to a JSON string across the mutation/transaction boundary; test code must `JSON.parse` it.
   - Mocking `@convex-dev/agent` requires the `Agent` export to be a class because `chat/agent.ts` does `new Agent(...)` at module load. Stub `createThread`, `saveMessage`, `listMessages`, and `Agent` with a `.continueThread()` method.
   - Clearing `streamingInProgress` between successive `sendMessage` calls on the same conversation is required or the concurrency guard throws a plain `Error` before the rate limiter runs.
   - The `@convex-dev/rate-limiter` component must be `registerComponent("rateLimiter", schema, glob)`-ed using its pnpm-resolved `src/component/` path; paste the path once and extract into a helper.
2. Update the **"Rate limits"** subsection to list `sendMessageDailyAnon` (token bucket, 200/day, capacity 50, keyed by `profileOwnerId`) and `sendMessageDailyAuth` (500/day, capacity 100, keyed by `appUser._id`), both applied in BOTH `sendMessage` branches and in `retryMessage`. Note the re-keying of `retryMessage`'s per-minute limit from `conversationId` to `profileOwnerId`/`appUser._id`.
3. Update the **"sendMessage pipeline"** section to reflect the new order: validate → auth → profileOwner → ownership → per-minute → daily → concurrency guard → createThread/saveMessage → patch lock → schedule action. Emphasize that both rate-limit checks MUST precede the lock patch (NFR-03).
4. Add `SYSTEM_PROMPT_MAX_CHARS = 6000` (helpers.ts) and `RAG_CHUNK_MAX_CHARS = 800` / `RAG_CONTEXT_MAX_CHARS = 4000` (actions.ts, exported) to the "Gotchas & Edge Cases" section as constants the next session should not accidentally tune.
5. Add `ConvexError({ code: "RATE_LIMIT_MINUTE" | "RATE_LIMIT_DAILY", retryAfterMs })` as the rate-limit rejection contract, with a note that `retryAfter` from `@convex-dev/rate-limiter` is in milliseconds (NOT seconds — pass through directly).

## 2026-04-30 — Read-only domain review: Bio tab + RAG ingestion proposal

**Task**: Domain review of a proposed Bio-tab feature where work/education entries become RAG context for the clone-chat agent. No code changes — review only, with concrete file paths and severity-rated concerns.

**Reuse audit**: knowledge.md "Architecture", "Data Flow & Contracts" (§streamResponse, §composeSystemPrompt), and "Wave 1 Constants" sections used directly — answered every question about chat-layer surface without re-deriving. Read only what knowledge.md didn't already pin down: `embeddings/schema.ts`, `embeddings/actions.ts`, `embeddings/mutations.ts`, `embeddings/queries.ts`, `embeddings/chunker.ts`, and one trigger callsite in `articles/mutations.ts`. ~7 reads for a cross-domain review — well under prior baselines.

**Bottleneck**: Knowledge.md described the RAG read path in detail but did not mention the **write-side trigger pattern** (`ctx.scheduler.runAfter(0, internal.embeddings.actions.generateEmbedding, ...)` from owning mutations, with `deleteBySource` for delete/unpublish). Had to grep for the pattern across `articles/` and `posts/` mutations. Cost: 1 extra read pass to find the canonical example.

**Counterfactual**: *"If knowledge.md had included a 'RAG ingestion (write-side)' subsection with the trigger pattern + idempotency contract (`deleteBySource → embedMany → insertChunks`) + the closed `sourceTable` validator gotcha, this review would have cost 1 fewer read pass, because I'd have known the extension shape and validator drift surface up front."*

**Patch** (knowledge.md):

1. Add a new subsection **"RAG ingestion (write-side, adjacent — not chat-owned)"** under "Architecture" capturing:
   - Trigger pattern: `ctx.scheduler.runAfter(0, internal.embeddings.actions.generateEmbedding, { sourceTable, sourceId })` from owning create/update mutation; `internal.embeddings.mutations.deleteBySource` on delete/unpublish. Canonical examples: `articles/mutations.ts:62, :164, :193`; `posts/mutations.ts:75, :168, :176`.
   - Idempotency: `generateEmbedding` itself calls `deleteBySource` then `insertChunks`, so re-runs are safe.
   - **`sourceTable` is a closed `v.union(v.literal("articles"), v.literal("posts"))`** declared inline at six call sites (`embeddings/schema.ts:6`, `embeddings/queries.ts:9, :21, :24`, `embeddings/actions.ts:15`, `embeddings/mutations.ts:6, :29`). Adding a third source means editing all six places + `pnpm exec convex codegen`. Recommend extracting into a single shared validator if a third source ever lands.
   - `chunkText` in `embeddings/chunker.ts` is paragraph/sentence-aware with `maxSize=2000, overlap=200` — built for prose. Short structured records should bypass it (one-chunk-per-record templated string) rather than feeding through the chunker.
2. Add a **Cross-user retrieval invariant** bullet under "Gotchas & Edge Cases":
   - The vector search filter `q.eq("userId", profileOwnerId)` at `chat/actions.ts:104` is the *only* line preventing cross-user leakage of any source in `contentEmbeddings`. Ingestion code MUST set `userId` from server-derived owner (never from a client arg). When adding a new `sourceTable`, add a regression test that asserts the filter is still pinned to `profileOwnerId` for that source.

## 2026-04-30 — Phase 4 review of bio-tab spec (post-draft)

**Task**: Re-review the drafted `workspace/spec/2026-04-30-bio-tab-spec.md` for chat-domain regressions. Read-only, severity-rated concerns.

**Reuse audit**: knowledge.md §"Architecture", §"Wave 1 Constants", §"convex-test harness gotchas" reused directly. Prior log (this same session, earlier) had the proposal-stage concerns; spec author folded most of them in. New reads only: `embeddings/queries.ts`, `embeddings/actions.ts`, `embeddings/mutations.ts`, `embeddings/schema.ts`, `chat/actions.ts`, `chat/__tests__/ragContext.test.ts`, `ls` of `chat/__tests__/`, two greps. ~6 reads — slightly higher than ideal, but all were verifying spec claims against real code (each read directly produced a citation).

**Bottleneck**: The spec proposes `getContentForEmbedding` returns a unified shape `{ title, body, slug, userId, status }` for all sources, with bio's `body` being a serialized string. Verifying whether this works required reading both the validator (queries.ts:25-34) AND the consumer (actions.ts:35-37) — the validator accepts `v.any()` so it superficially looks fine, but `actions.ts:35` does `extractPlainText(content.body as JSONContent)` unconditionally, which will crash on a string. Spec says "bypass chunker" but didn't say "bypass extractPlainText" — that's the actual blocker. Cost: 2 reads to find vs. 1 if the spec had named the consumer.

**Counterfactual**: *"If knowledge.md had a one-line note 'getContentForEmbedding's `body: v.any()` is consumed by extractPlainText which assumes JSONContent — string-body ingestion sources must branch the call site, not just the validator', the verification of spec concern #1 would have taken 1 read instead of 2, because I'd have known the trap up front."*

**Patch** (knowledge.md):

Add to §"Gotchas & Edge Cases" a bullet:

- **`getContentForEmbedding` consumer asymmetry.** The validator returns `body: v.any()`, but `embeddings/actions.ts:35-37` consumes it as `extractPlainText(content.body as JSONContent)` — assumes a TipTap JSON tree. Adding an ingestion source whose `body` is a plain string MUST branch the actions.ts call site, not just widen the validator. Failing to do so produces a runtime crash inside `extractPlainText` walking `.content[]` on a string. The same branch is the natural place to bypass `chunkText` for short structured records.

This patches the gap that cost a read this session, and pre-empts the same trap when the bio implementation lands.

## 2026-04-30 — Wave 1 executor: Bio backend + RAG plumbing (feature-socials)

**Task**: Execute Wave 1 of `2026-04-30-bio-tab-spec.md` — Convex bio CRUD module, embeddings refactor (shared `embeddingSourceTableValidator`, optional slug, discriminated `kind` union, status-gate-by-kind), chat `actions.ts` header rename + `buildRagContext` widening, three new test files, vitest config glob widening, and a new `.claude/rules/embeddings.md` for the cross-user `userId` provenance rule.

**Reuse audit**: knowledge.md §Architecture, §Wave 1 Constants, §"convex-test harness gotchas" reused directly — every convex-test scaffold (glob normalization, ConvexError JSON-string trap, Agent class shape, auth/client mock spec path, `ai`/`@ai-sdk/google` mocks) was applied on the first pass for three new test files. Prior 2026-04-30 review entry pre-empted the `extractPlainText` consumer asymmetry, so the bio branch was discriminated from the start. Net: zero rediscovered traps.

**Evidence**:
- `pnpm exec convex codegen --typecheck disable` (with `CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=dev:quick-turtle-404`) exit 0
- `pnpm --filter=@feel-good/convex test` exit 0 — **97/97 tests pass across 13 files** (was 21/4 pre-Wave-1; new: bio queries 5, bio mutations 13, bio serializeForEmbedding 12, embeddings/bio-source 9 incl. 3-table parameterized I5, chat/rag-cross-user 2, chat/ragContext +5 assertions for header literal + slug branches)
- `pnpm build --filter=@feel-good/mirror` exit 0
- `pnpm --filter=@feel-good/convex check-types` exit 0
- `git diff packages/convex/convex/chat/actions.ts` — `finally`+`clearStreamingLock`+`expectedStartedAt` block intact at line 163; `console.error` RAG fallthrough intact at line 142

**Bottleneck**: **Convex's module-name path constraint.** Created `bio/serialize-for-embedding.ts` (kebab-case) on first pass — TypeScript and Vitest were happy, but `convex codegen` rejected with `InvalidConfig: bio/serialize-for-embedding.js is not a valid path to a Convex module. Path component serialize-for-embedding.js can only contain alphanumeric characters, underscores, or periods.` Renamed to `serializeForEmbedding.ts` and updated the two import sites + the test file's relative import. Cost: 1 iteration. Otherwise, the whole 12-file Wave 1 landed clean on first try.

Secondary bottleneck (worth 0.5 iteration): `pnpm exec convex codegen` requires `CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT` env to be set — the codegen needs a real deployment to upload functions to. Discovered via the first invocation hitting `✖ No CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT set`. Used `CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=dev:quick-turtle-404` from `apps/mirror/.env.local` (only `CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT`, NOT `CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY` — per the persistent memory entry, the latter overrides the former and silently routes to prod).

**Counterfactual**: *"If knowledge.md had a 'Convex module-name constraint' subsection saying 'non-test files inside `convex/` MUST use camelCase or snake_case — kebab-case fails at codegen with InvalidConfig', this would have cost ~0 iterations instead of 1, because I'd have named the file `serializeForEmbedding.ts` from the start (matching `chat/tonePresets.ts`, `embeddings/textExtractor.ts`)."*

**Patches applied**:

1. (knowledge.md) New §"Convex module-name constraint (learned 2026-04-30)" — captures the kebab-case → InvalidConfig rule with the exact error message, the workaround (camelCase or snake_case), and the test-file exception (`__tests__/` directories aren't bundled).

2. (knowledge.md) New §"RAG ingestion (write-side, adjacent — not chat-owned)" under §Architecture — captures: shared `embeddingSourceTableValidator`, three sources (articles/posts/bioEntries), trigger pattern + idempotency, discriminated-union shape (`kind: "doc" | "bio"`), `slug: v.optional(v.string())` with the iter2-Finding1 trap (fetchChunksByIds returns validator must also be optional, else bio chunks rejected on retrieval and silently swallowed by the catch in streamResponse), and the `userId` provenance rule with a forward reference to `.claude/rules/embeddings.md`.

3. (knowledge.md §Gotchas) Updated `getContentForEmbedding` consumer-asymmetry bullet — reflects the now-implemented discriminated union; future ingestion sources should mirror the bio branch (single chunk, no extractPlainText, no chunker), not widen the doc branch.

4. (knowledge.md §Wave 1 Constants) Added `RAG_CONTEXT_HEADER` literal and the `slug?` widening of `buildRagContext`'s parameter type — locks the bio link-omission semantics.

5. (knowledge.md §Test runner) Updated the include-glob list to the current 5 globs (chat, betaAllowlist, waitlistRequests, bio, embeddings).

6. (`.claude/rules/embeddings.md`, new file) The `userId from getAppUser only` rule, with the `by_embedding` userId-filter context and the canonical 5-step "adding a new ingestion source" checklist. Auto-loads under `packages/convex/convex/embeddings/**`.

**Scope deviation**: None. The kebab-case rename was a forced fix (Convex constraint), not a deviation from the spec — the spec said the file lives in `packages/convex/convex/bio/` and the contents/exports/tests are unchanged. Updated all spec-mentioned imports and the test file's relative import to the new name; the public API (`serializeBioEntryForEmbedding`) is identical.

**Open follow-ups**: None for Wave 1 backend. Wave 2 (frontend `features/profile-tabs`, `features/content`) and Wave 3 (`features/bio` + routes) are explicitly out of scope and untouched.
