/**
 * Tool-side internal queries powering `buildCloneTools` in `chat/tools.ts`.
 *
 * Critical isolation invariant (matches `.claude/rules/embeddings.md`):
 * `userId` here is a SERVER-derived argument — `chat/actions.ts:streamResponse`
 * already has `profileOwnerId` in scope and the tool factory closes over it.
 * The LLM-visible tool `inputSchema` MUST NOT expose `userId`. These queries
 * are internal-only and are not reachable from any client code path.
 *
 * Articles and posts queries pin `status === "published"` so:
 *  - `queryLatestPublished` never returns drafts (consistent with what RAG
 *    chunks see; drafts are not retrieval-eligible).
 *  - `resolveBySlug` returns `null` for drafts even when slug + userId match,
 *    so a chat agent cannot navigate the visitor to an unpublished URL.

/**
 * Canonical href builder for content the chat agent navigates the visitor to.
 *
 * Exported so unit tests can assert the exact href shape without going through
 * the tool-execute path (the convex-test harness has no first-class way to
 * invoke `Tool.execute(...)` synthetically because the AI SDK injects ctx via
 * a `__acceptsCtx` symbol). Centralizing the template here means the tool
 * surface and the test surface share one source of truth — a typo in the
 * template surfaces in both `resolveBySlug`'s return and the helper unit test.
 *
 * Format: `/@<username>/<articles|posts>/<slug>` — must stay aligned with the
 * Next.js route at `apps/mirror/app/[username]/<kind>/[slug]/page.tsx`.
 *
 * Mirror of `getContentHref` in
 * `apps/mirror/features/content/types.ts`. Both must produce the same
 * canonical `/@<username>/<kind>/<slug>` shape — the client's
 * `useAgentIntentWatcher` trusts the server-built `href` from this
 * helper, and the user-UI list items call `getContentHref` directly.
 * Tests on both sides pin the format.
