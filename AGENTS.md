# Feel Good Monorepo

Turborepo monorepo. Two Next.js 15 (App Router, React 19) apps backed by a shared Convex deployment (real-time queries + Better Auth), with UI primitives in `packages/ui` and cross-app feature modules in `packages/features`.

Full project map (apps, packages, ports, auth layers): [`docs/project-map.md`](docs/project-map.md).

## Commands

```bash
pnpm install                          # Install all workspaces
pnpm -r build                          # Build every workspace
pnpm dev --filter=<app>                # Run a single app (see app-specific AGENTS.md for filter values)
```

App-specific commands live in each app's `AGENTS.md` (`apps/mirror/AGENTS.md`, `apps/ui-factory/AGENTS.md`).

## Deploy & Build Footguns

Two things about the Vercel/Convex setup are easy to break and hard to diagnose — read before touching:

- **`turbo.json` `globalEnv` array.** Any env var read by Next or Convex at build time must be listed here, or Turbo filters it out before the build subprocess sees it. Owner: [`.claude/rules/auth.md` § Monorepo deploy gotcha](.claude/rules/auth.md).
- **Vercel build command.** Root Directory is `apps/mirror` but Convex lives at `packages/convex/convex/`. The build walks up with `cd ../../packages/convex && npx convex deploy --cmd "cd ../../apps/mirror && ..."`. Do not simplify this. Owner: [`.claude/rules/auth.md` § Monorepo deploy gotcha](.claude/rules/auth.md).

## Core Principles

- **Always Choose the Compounding Option** — You should ALWAYS choose the option that compounds, that architecturally makes the codebase less prone for error and never choose the quick wins. When a bug or feedback reveals a gap in a skill, rule, convention, or template, patch the upstream artifact before (or alongside) fixing the downstream instance.
- **Git workflow** — Never commit directly to main. Always use feature branches. When a merge conflict or branch divergence occurs, stop and ask the user before force-pushing or resetting.

## Project Rules

Detailed conventions live in `.claude/rules/`. All rules auto-load via `paths:` frontmatter unless noted.

- **[Auth](.claude/rules/auth.md)** — Better Auth running inside Convex; Next.js only proxies `/api/auth/*`. **Check before debugging sign-in, OAuth, or session cookies — the URL/host choreography between `.convex.cloud`, `.convex.site`, and the app domain is the #1 footgun.**
- **[Convex](.claude/rules/convex.md)** — function guidelines, validators, schema, query/mutation patterns. Auto-loads under `packages/convex/convex/**`.
- **[Verification](.claude/rules/verification.md)** — build/lint/Chrome-MCP tiers per change type. **Run the matching tier before reporting any task complete.**
- **[File organization](.claude/rules/file-organization.md)** — where components/hooks/utils/schemas live in a feature module. All React components go in `components/`; `views/` is reserved for cross-app packages.
- **[Forms](.claude/rules/forms.md)** — React Hook Form + Zod + `zodResolver`; shadcn `Form` primitives from `@feel-good/ui/primitives/form`; schemas live in each feature's `lib/schemas/`.
- **[Identifiers](.claude/rules/identifiers.md)** — slugs/handles/codes must pass through one canonical normalizer at the mutation boundary; never `args.slug || generate(...)`; always `generate(args.slug ?? args.title)` plus an `assertValid…` check before DB write.
- **[React components](.claude/rules/react-components.md)** — components under ~100 lines; **never `setTimeout` to fix rendering timing — use Suspense, view-transition isolation, or `startTransition` instead.**
- **[State management](.claude/rules/state-management.md)** — three-tier hierarchy: `useState`/`useReducer` → `useLocalStorage` → React Context. Zustand is not used in this repo.
- **[Tailwind](.claude/rules/tailwind.md)** — Tailwind v4, CSS-first config (no `tailwind.config.js`); use `@source` to scan shared packages; three-layer token system (Radix → semantic → `@theme inline`).
- **[TypeScript](.claude/rules/typescript.md)** — inline type imports; feature types in `features/<feature>/types.ts`, shared in `types/<domain>.types.ts`.
- **[Providers](.claude/rules/providers.md)** — separate client singleton (`lib/<service>.ts`) from React provider (`providers/<service>-provider.tsx`); never `!` on `process.env`; lazy-init external clients.
- **[Testing](.claude/rules/testing.md)** — **Playwright CLI only for e2e tests.** Never the Playwright MCP plugin or browser-automation MCP tools.
- **[Dev process](.claude/rules/dev-process.md)** — session discipline, planning, problem-solving flow; **after any correction, update `workspace/lessons.md`.**
- **[App-specific](.claude/rules/apps/)** — per-app topic rules (see `apps/mirror/` for current files).
- **[Sentry](.claude/rules/sentry/)** — exception capture, tracing spans, and logger patterns for Next.js.

Convex-specific instructions and the canonical guidelines file live under [`packages/convex/AGENTS.md`](packages/convex/AGENTS.md) and [`packages/convex/convex/_generated/ai/guidelines.md`](packages/convex/convex/_generated/ai/guidelines.md). Both are managed by `npx convex ai-files install` from `packages/convex/`.
