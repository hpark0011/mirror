# Lessons Learned

## 2026-02-12

- When a model has both `published_at` and `created_at`, do not assume one generic date filter; confirm whether each date needs its own submenu and separate owner-visibility rules.
- For toolbar filter UIs, default root "filter by..." search to narrowing dropdown options only unless the user explicitly wants it to affect the list query.

- When using `@feel-good/ui/primitives/drawer`, every `DrawerContent` must include a `DrawerTitle` (can be hidden with `sr-only` via `DrawerHeader`) to satisfy Radix Dialog accessibility requirements and avoid runtime accessibility errors.
