# Lessons Learned

- If a transition bug reproduces only at extreme scroll positions (top works, bottom fails), treat it as a scroll-state/timing issue first (`useLayoutEffect` + `ViewTransition` + `scrollTo` ordering), not as static toolbar styling/geometry.
- Before patching visual styles, validate the hypothesis against the reported repro axis (e.g., scroll position dependence). If a proposed fix would affect all scroll positions equally, it is likely the wrong root cause for a bottom-only bug.

- When a model has both `published_at` and `created_at`, do not assume one generic date filter; confirm whether each date needs its own submenu and separate owner-visibility rules.
- For toolbar filter UIs, default root "filter by..." search to narrowing dropdown options only unless the user explicitly wants it to affect the list query.

- When using `@feel-good/ui/primitives/drawer`, every `DrawerContent` must include a `DrawerTitle` (can be hidden with `sr-only` via `DrawerHeader`) to satisfy Radix Dialog accessibility requirements and avoid runtime accessibility errors.
